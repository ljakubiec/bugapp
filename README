BUG APPLICATION

This sample bug application was developed for a workshop at the Dutch PHP
Conference (2008). It is incomplete and completely unstyled, and comes with
absolutely no guarantees whatsoever. Its sole purpose was to provide a basis for
the examples and direction of the workshop. Use and modify at your own risk.

You may need to edit public/.htaccess slightly to specify your native timezone;
otherwise, simply setup a vhost pointing the document root at public/ and start
playing.
